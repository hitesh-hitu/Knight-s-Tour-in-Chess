# Knight-s-Tour-in-Chess
The knight’s tour problem is a sub chess puzzle where the objective is to find the combinations made by the knight so that it visits every square of the chess board exactly once.

This project consists of three approaches to solve this problem.
The first one is using the brute-force algorithm followed by backtracking . The next approach is using warnsdorff's rule which is a heuristic for finding knight’s tour.
